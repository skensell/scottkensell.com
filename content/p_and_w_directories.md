Summary: A simple strategy for organizing personal and work directories.

With my inaugural blog post, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite topics:
staying organized in the file system.

You see, I have my terminal set up nicely to display which directory I'm in.
It displays not just the last path component but the full path of the 
directory.

Since I spend most of my time on my work computer, I end up doing a lot of 
personal things on it too. To avoid mixing my work and personal files I 
obviously created separate places for these things to live. So in my home
directory were born the `work` and `personal` directories.

These directories were living happily until I realized that each directory
was accumulating a lot of junk.
