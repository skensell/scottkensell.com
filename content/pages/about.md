Title: About

Because I've only been programming for a few years, I feel like I have lots to learn. 
As the masses of information come flying at me, every now and then I learn something I think is so useful that I just want to share it with the world. 
So I created a blog with a very uninspired title. 
My goal is that at least one noob out there learn at least one useful thing from here.

So this is a blog by a noob for noobs.

Officially I'm a junior iOS developer at Prezi. My favorite topics are Python, shell scripting, and Objective-C.
