Title: About

Two years into math grad school, I decided I'd like to try my hand at programming.
After a lot of online courses and books, I learned enough for them to hire me at Prezi where I am now happily coding in the iOS team.

As the masses of information come flying at me, every now and then I learn something I think is so useful that I just want to share it with the world.
Hence, the blog.
I hope this blog is especially useful for other people trying to change their career path to become a developer.

My favorite topics currently are Objective-C/iOS development and functional (reactive) programming.
