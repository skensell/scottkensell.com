Sunday evening our CTO writes the following to our developers forum:

  Reply to if you want to learn Elm, FP and FRP.
  This week you come: 5 times, every day, 1pm-2pm.
  You can bring your food/brown bag...Friday we will be present a html5 snake.

Four days of wtf, one evening of synthesizing others' code, and one day of refactoring later, I'm playing this little game here (refresh the page to restart):
</p>

<div id="ScottsSnake" style="margin: 0 auto; width:50%; height:221px; margin-bottom: 10px"></div>

<p>
Learning functional programming (FP) and functional reactive programming (FRP) had been on my long-term roadmap anyways. So I figured why wait?
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Why FP?</h3>

<p>
I've been learning Objective-C pretty religiously for the last 4 months as a new member in the iOS team at Prezi. Before Objective-C, I was pretty familiar with Python and C, and now I feel quite comfortable with the object-oriented paradigm. My only FP experience would be my familiarity with Python's map, filter, reduce and lambda functions (if that counts).
</p>

<p>
It seems like the whole developer world is talking about FP. One of my friends summarized the <a href="http://craft-conf.com/2014/">CRAFT conference</a> to me as "Yeah one of the overarching themes was definitely the shift from OOP to FP."
</p>

<p>
Why should an Objective-C/iOS developer care about FRP? Well, at Prezi we are using <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">Reactive Cocoa</a> more and more. Our experienced Objective-C developers seem to be writing almost exclusively with Reactive Cocoa. It seems that everybody is adopting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_extensions">reactive programming</a> principles nowadays saying that it leads to cleaner, more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative</a> code.
</p>

<p>
Justification aside, it's always fun to learn new technologies right?
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Elm</h3>

<p>
Elm left a positive first impression on me. It's a functional language which compiles to HTML/CSS/Javascript which in itself is pretty cool. But if you need more reasons, here's a few:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Whitespace.</strong> Not a fan of braces? Yeah, me neither. Python enthusiasts should feel at home. I mean who can resist an if-else branch which looks like this:
</p>


<div>
  <pre><code> directionFromArrows arrows direction =
  if  | arrows.x < 0 -> Left
      | arrows.x > 0 -> Right
      | arrows.y > 0 -> Up
      | arrows.y < 0 -> Down
      | otherwise -> direction </code></pre>
</div>

  - Why FRP? ... ReactiveCocoa + prepare for the paradigm shift.

Why Elm?
  - If a functional language compiling to html/css/javascript isn't enough for you, here's some more reasons why elm is pretty cool..

Getting used to FP syntax

<!-- Embed the snake game -->
<script type="text/javascript" src='{filename}javascript/elm-runtime.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='{filename}javascript/ScottsSnake.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript'>
var div = document.getElementById('ScottsSnake');
Elm.embed(Elm.ScottsSnake, div);
</script>

<!-- Disable arrow keys for scrolling so that the game can use them -->
<script type='text/javascript'>
window.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
    // space and arrow keys
    if([32, 37, 38, 39, 40].indexOf(e.keyCode) > -1) {
        e.preventDefault();
    }
}, false);
